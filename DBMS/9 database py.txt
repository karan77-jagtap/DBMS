Step 1: Setup & Connect Python to MySQL

Make sure you have:

MySQL server installed and running

A database named testdb (or any name you prefer)

Python installed with mysql-connector-python library

If you haven’t installed the connector yet, run:



pip install mysql-connector-python

Step 2: Create table (run once)



Create a script called create_table.py to create your table:

import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

try:
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host='localhost',
        database='testdb',        # change if you use another db
        user='root',
        password='your_password'  # change to your password
    )
    
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        
        cursor.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
                emp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
                name VARCHAR(50),
                salary DECIMAL(10,2)
            )
        """)
        print("Table 'employees' created successfully.")
        
except Error as e:
    print("Error:", e)

finally:
    if connection.is_connected():
        cursor.close()
        connection.close()




Run this script once:

python create_table.py



Step 3: Insert Operation

Save this as insert_employee.py:



import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def insert_employee(name, salary):
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='localhost',
            database='testdb',
            user='root',
            password='your_password'
        )
        
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            sql = "INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES (%s, %s)"
            cursor.execute(sql, (name, salary))
            connection.commit()
            print(f"Inserted employee: {name} with salary {salary}")

    except Error as e:
        print("Error:", e)
    finally:
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()

# Example usage:
insert_employee("Alice", 60000)




Run:

python insert_employee.py



Now check your MySQL table:

SELECT * FROM employees;


You should see Alice there.




Step 4: Select (Read) Operation

Save as select_employees.py:

import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def select_employees():
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='localhost',
            database='testdb',
            user='root',
            password='your_password'
        )
        
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            cursor.execute("SELECT emp_id, name, salary FROM employees")
            rows = cursor.fetchall()
            
            print("Employees:")
            for row in rows:
                print(row)

    except Error as e:
        print("Error:", e)
    finally:
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()

# Example usage:
select_employees()




Run:

python select_employees.py





Step 5: Update Operation

Save as update_employee.py:

import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def update_employee_salary(name, new_salary):
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='localhost',
            database='testdb',
            user='root',
            password='your_password'
        )
        
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            sql = "UPDATE employees SET salary = %s WHERE name = %s"
            cursor.execute(sql, (new_salary, name))
            connection.commit()
            print(f"Updated salary for {name} to {new_salary}")

    except Error as e:
        print("Error:", e)
    finally:
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()

# Example usage:
update_employee_salary("Alice", 65000)


Run:

python update_employee.py


Then run select_employees.py to see the updated salary.



Step 6: Delete Operation

Save as delete_employee.py:

import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def delete_employee(name):
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='localhost',
            database='testdb',
            user='root',
            password='your_password'
        )
        
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            sql = "DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = %s"
            cursor.execute(sql, (name,))
            connection.commit()
            print(f"Deleted employee: {name}")

    except Error as e:
        print("Error:", e)
    finally:
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()

# Example usage:
delete_employee("Alice")


Run:

python delete_employee.py


Run select_employees.py again to verify deletion.







Summary

Run create_table.py once to create the table.

Run insert_employee.py to add a record.

Run select_employees.py to view records.

Run update_employee.py to update a record.

Run delete_employee.py to delete a record.
